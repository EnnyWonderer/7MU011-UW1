## Music Performance
I've been looking into ways to improve self learning within music performance and production. I'd been fairly decent with production but not very consistent and the only performances I'd done was rapping to backing tracks. So I decided I'd dive in the deep end and start playing keyboard at gigs for other artists while figuring out songs of my own. I was a challenging experience having to learn someones songs when I've never even experienced playing an instrument live before and so after somehow surviving the first rehearsal with different bands I would put my head down and work out as much theory behind their music as possible so that I had a better understanding for what it was I was attempting to do.


Evenutally I formed a group called Oneironauts playing my own music which meant I was at least more familiar with it our first piece of promotional material was released which lead to a lot of gig offers.

Being the writer and performer of my own music allowed me to experiment with different factors that would entertain an audience

Our adventures as the Oneironauts found us gigging for the Sofar sounds circuit straight off the back of the first video and they wanted to film it to go on their channel

Thankfully this video wasn't released. I think the pressure really god us with this one. A big filled event and being filmed, I remember feeling like I was gonna black out during one of the songs. Not long after we were being booked for more Sofar sounds events across the UK and did another filmed gig in Bristol (this time we were a bit more comfortable, we've gotten better since but this was good enough). The video didn't get released until late December.

Some reason we are really in there with the food scene and recieved regular gig requests from the stable pizza franchise and Mama Roux in birmingham great food, drinks and good times. We launched stable pizza's 'Stable Sessions' to promote their live music events.

We made attempts at recording an E.P at the Uni. Time constraints makes this difficult and I think expectations was to have the perfect takes first time and leave with a full made project. from experience I tried to set it up to be a series of days to really figure out how to best set up and record, it wasn't the best final product as we should have used a click track to keep everything synced up. the layout we used meant it wasn't very easy to hear the percussion playing and the tempo kept changing between the chorus and verses. I think if we find a way to agree on approach and time to explore different recording methods, we could create a successful project. there was still fun moments though.

## Wake'n'Make Production Videos


This shows the birth of the Wake'n'Make concept, through developing a pilot based of peoples interaction it was fine tuned to both entertain and inspire.

It appeared to be a very successful endeavour, regular messages from people showing their interest in the files made and joining the mailing list to have access to the files. After taking a break from regular posting a friend brought up the idea of branching it out further. Having it as a curator for new music and art and eventually sell merch and sponsor artists. WHY THE HECK NOT!?

Once I was sure that it was a concept that people were interested in, I Made the Wake'n'Make social media pages and bought the URL www.wakenmake.co.uk (not yet running). I searched for the designer of the popular GIF file 'hang loose' and asked about using their GIF as the official logo for wake'n'make.
I don't know if it was the idea of me offering a percentage of any profits made that put him of but after that he wouldn't even accept money... I told him the idea of the potential merch and stuff and he dissed me. The discussion showed me that they were not willing to negotiate what so ever and was playing very difficult even when trying to establish a better deal. So I designed a temp banner logo myself.

I found myself responding to people who wanted to do their own wakenmakes with "yeah its really habit forming" and so came up with the slogan 'consistency becomes habitual' I also wanted to keep the feel of the 'stoner creative' vibe and so went with Hemp themed colour (spin-off to wake'n'bake... maybe I was high when I started making these videos).



Since there is now a label on it, its become much harder to grow the Wake'n'Make concept. People agreed to be on the mailing list to do their own creations and I started sending out weekly challenges, but was getting nothing back... I even started to figure out how to encorporate a bit more hints and tips into the creative process so it was both entertaining and educational. The break between the last videos meant I was getting less veiwers and so I felt stuck. it was becoming difficult to find time to manage creating posts to do daily and so I took a break to figure out a more convenient approach.

## Future Bubblers and MOBO's helped.

During my journey in performance:

 I played for ali at giles house at the fest etc
 
bubblers came to wolves showed them my own stuff

they booked oneironauts for block party

applied to be a future bubbler

got it

at the induction they brought it funders

never usually worked

applied with a motive in mind

got it

With being selected for the future bubblers of 2020 and having my application for funding from the MOBO's help musician funders. I'll be able to manage social media content with scheduled posts by signing up to hootsuit. I'm going to use the existing #wakenmake posts found on the hashtag and repost them to fill the page with more content. This will influence other artists to post their work as it will look like the page is busy and a lot more established. also the workload will be a lot easier as I wont have to monitor it everyday to make posts etc


## SynesTeacher Build


Unfortunately, starting this project was proving very difficult due to financial situations. I spend a lot of time trying to do affordable trial and error to get a set up of lights which led to me burning out the NodeMCU amongst other things going wrong. Once I was making a bit of money I was able to afford the things I needed to get things going. Here's how that went:
