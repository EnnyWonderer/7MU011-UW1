## Wake'n'Make Production Videos


This shows the birth of the Wake'n'Make concept, through developing a pilot based of peoples interaction it was fine tuned to both entertain and inspire.

It appeared to be a very successful endeavour, regular messages from people showing their interest in the files made and joining the mailing list to have access to the files. After taking a break from regular posting a friend brought up the idea of branching it out further. Having it as a curator for new music and art and eventually sell merch and sponsor artists. WHY THE HECK NOT!?

Once I was sure that it was a concept that people were interested in, I Made the Wake'n'Make social media pages and bought the URL www.wakenmake.co.uk (not yet running). I searched for the designer of the popular GIF file 'hang loose' and asked about using their GIF as the official logo for wake'n'make.
I don't know if it was the idea of me offering a percentage of any profits made that put him of but after that he wouldn't even accept money... I told him the idea of the potential merch and stuff and he dissed me. The discussion showed me that they were not willing to negotiate what so ever and was playing very difficult even when trying to establish a better deal. So I designed a temp banner logo myself.

I found myself responding to people who wanted to do their own wakenmakes with "yeah its really habit forming" and so came up with the slogan 'consistency becomes habitual' I also wanted to keep the feel of the 'stoner creative' vibe and so went with Hemp themed colour (spin-off to wake'n'bake... maybe I was high when I started making these videos).

Since there is now a label on it, its become much harder to grow the Wake'n'Make concept. People agreed to be on the mailing list to do their own creations and I started sending out weekly challenges, but was getting nothing back... it was becoming difficult to find time to manage creating posts to do daily and so I took a break.

I'll be able to manage social media content with scheduled posts by signing up to hootsuit. I'm going to use the existing #wakenmake posts found on the hashtag and repost them to fill the page with more content. This will influence other artists to post their work as it will look like the page is busy and a lot more established. also the workload will be a lot easier as I wont have to monitor it everyday to make posts etc


## SynesTeacher Build


Unfortunately, starting this project was proving very difficult due to financial situations. I spend a lot of time trying to do affordable trial and error to get a set up of lights which led to me burning out the NodeMCU amongst other things going wrong. Once I was making a bit of money I was able to afford the things I needed to get things going. Here's how that went:
