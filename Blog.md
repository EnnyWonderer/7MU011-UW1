## Music Performance
I've been looking into ways to improve self learning within music performance and production. I'd been fairly decent with production but not very consistent and the only performances I'd done was rapping to backing tracks. So I decided I'd dive in the deep end and start playing keyboard at gigs for other artists while figuring out songs of my own. It was a challenging experience having to learn someone’s songs when I've never even experienced playing an instrument live before and so after somehow surviving the first rehearsal with different bands I would put my head down and work out as much theory behind their music as possible so that I had a better understanding for what it was I was attempting to do.

As an aid to learning theory, I started tutoring music production and adding in the bits of theory that I'd learnt. I found that if you can communicate something in many different ways then it becomes solidified in your knowledge bank. The tutoring sessions further progressed into teaching at the royal school of Wolverhampton and at the switch project in Dovecoats primary (the switch project is for the development of teenagers outside of education). Working in such environments, having to come up with my own plans of study and witnessing that they wont just be engaged by whatever you deliver really improved my skills of adapting a learning plan on the fly. The first sessions were the scariest, the kids literally huff and puff until you start doing something they will potentially enjoy at it felt like constant rejection. Even more difficult is when you have to deliver a music workshop in a school that has no working equipment and you have to find as many non-broken things as possible to put together a decent class. Once I'd delivered a terms worth of workshops I'd went with an approach to better serve their requirements and would ask each student what they want to focus on, if they didn't know I would show them something different each time until they found what they liked. 

I formed a group called Oneironauts playing my own music which meant I was at least more familiar with it. Being the writer and performer of my own music allowed me to experiment with different factors that would entertain an audience, each rehearsal we would figure out different ways and fine tune our performances # find Daniel Levitin quote. The band consists of Shiv - Cajon and vocals, Cooper - Bass and backing vocals and myself - Keyboard and vocals. Our first video was done during a rehearsal upstairs in a pub and the release was well received, leading to a lot of gig offers.

Our adventures as the Oneironauts found us gigging for the Sofar sounds circuit straight off the back of the first video and they wanted to film it to go on their channel

Thankfully this video wasn't released, I think the pressure really got to us with this one I was making a series of mistakes in the performance. A big filled event and being filmed, I remember feeling like I was gonna black out during one of the songs. However the audience still loved what they heard and we managed to make a good enough impression. Not long after we were being booked for more Sofar sounds events across the UK and did another filmed gig in Bristol (this time we were a bit more comfortable, we've gotten better since but this was good enough). The video didn't get released until late December.

Some reason we are really in there with the food scene and received regular gig requests from the stable pizza franchise and Digbeth dining club in Birmingham (great food, drinks and good times). We launched stable pizza's 'Stable Sessions' to promote their live music events.

We made attempts at recording an E.P at the Uni. Time constraints makes this difficult and I think expectations was to have the perfect takes first time and leave with a full made project. from experience I tried to set it up to be a series of days to really figure out how to best set up and record, it wasn't the best final product as we should have used a click track to keep everything synced up. the layout we used meant it wasn't very easy to hear the percussion playing and the tempo kept changing between the chorus and verses. I think if we find a way to agree on approach and time to explore different recording methods, we could create a successful project. there was still fun moments though.

Here's some more lil snippets of what we get up to on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oneironauts_music/?hl=en) 

## Wake'n'Make Production Videos

For production, I wanted to improve my consistency of making files as it wasn't a regular enough practice, I also wanted to have more content to promote my artist page as I hadn't been releasing any music. This shows the birth of the Wake'n'Make concept, through developing a pilot based of people’s interaction it was fine tuned to both entertain and inspire. It's in the name, wake up and make something.

It appeared to be a very successful endeavour, regular messages from people showing their interest in the files made and joining the mailing list to have access to the files for writing purposes or to add their input to the production itself. Poets, rappers, producers and singers were all getting in contact to hear more. The creating process had become habitual and the experiment was complete. After taking a break from regular posting a friend brought up the idea of branching it out further. Having it as a curator for new music and art and eventually sell merch and sponsor artists. WHY THE HECK NOT!?

Once I was sure that it was a concept that people were interested in, I Made the Wake'n'Make social media pages and bought the URL www.wakenmake.co.uk (not yet running). I searched for the designer of the popular GIF file 'hang loose' and asked about using their GIF as the official logo for wake'n'make.
I don't know if it was the idea of me offering a percentage of any profits made that put him of but after that he wouldn't even accept money... I told him the idea of the potential merch and stuff and he dissed me. The discussion showed me that they were not willing to negotiate what so ever and was playing very difficult even when trying to establish a better deal. So I designed a temp banner logo myself.

I found myself responding to people who wanted to do their own wakenmakes with "yeah its really habit forming" and so came up with the slogan 'consistency becomes habitual' I also wanted to keep the feel of the 'stoner creative' vibe and so went with Hemp themed colour (spin-off to wake'n'bake... maybe I was high when I started making these videos).



Since there is now a label on it, its become much harder to grow the Wake'n'Make concept (possibly the pressure I've put on myself with putting a label on it taking away the free flowingness it once had). People agreed to be on the mailing list to do their own creations and I started sending out weekly challenges, but was getting nothing back... I even started to figure out how to incorporate a bit more hints and tips into the creative process so it was both entertaining and educational. The break between the last videos meant I was getting less viewers and so I felt stuck. it was becoming difficult to find time to manage creating posts to do daily and so I took a break to figure out a more convenient approach.

## Future Bubblers and MOBO's helped.

During my journey in performance I was playing keys for a band called 'Rais at Night' we had the opportunity to play at Giles Peterson's home studio sessions and at an event called future bubblers. The lead vocallist of the band was picked for a project called future bubblers which meant that alumni would be given special provisions such as a mentor and further progression within their music careers. Further in I played bass with the Rais at Night at Peterson's festival 'We Out Here Fest'. I spoke to some of the previous bubblers and they explained the benefits of being a future bubbler. The following month, the future bubblers team announced that Wolverhampton had become their next focus city and they wanted to meet artists to discuss their plans. The introduced the future bubblers project and encouraged us to apply, did interviews with all the artists and played the artists music on 'Worldwide FM'. I later recieved an email asking if the Oneironauts would perform for the Wolverhampton Bloc Party they would be setting up later down the line (a performance which had them impressed). I clumsily assumed that this meant that I was a potential candidate for the future bubblers until I luckily send out an email asking if the interview that was previously done counted as an application... the showed me how to apply properly.

Months passed and I was greatful to see that I had been seleceted for the future bubblers of 2020 and that I would be attending an induction where I would be given a press shot, would discuss who my music mentor would be (still waiting to find out) would be given workshops on music collaboration and abletonn live, and would be introduced to some funders to discuss what works and what doesn't work in applications.
Usually I read an application and find a reason why it doesn't apply to me, but after being selected for future bubblers it just felt like this may be the chance I'd been looking for to know that I'm worth this sort of thing. I spent time really thinking out a decent application and making sure I filled it out correctly to their requirements (leaving out my dream to save the world). Again, with luck on my side I was accepted for the funding and will recieve £2k to go towards developing my career.

With being selected for the future bubblers of 2020 and having my application for funding from the MOBO's help musician funders. I'll be able to manage social media content with scheduled posts by signing up to hootsuit. I'm going to use the existing #wakenmake posts found on the hashtag and repost them to fill the page with more content. This will influence other artists to post their work as it will look like the page is busy and a lot more established. also the workload will be a lot easier as I wont have to monitor it everyday to make posts etc


## SynesTeacher Build


Unfortunately, starting this project was proving very difficult due to financial situations. I spend a lot of time trying to do affordable trial and error to get a set up of lights which led to me burning out the NodeMCU amongst other things going wrong. Once I was making a bit of money I was able to afford the things I needed to get things going. Here's how that went:

[Folder - Build Vids](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iqhUnvicbheJ1rDDt8oQTr20BvJAMedQ)


the colours were taken from schraibins colour mapping and turned into RGB values using [PixelZoomer](http://pixelzoomer.com/eye-dropper-extract-hex-rgb-color-values/)

while developing my build I had to refer to the forum A LOT to be able to get certain outcome and I would come across something that would completely change the way I was trying to do a long process making it an extrememly easy and short one (like the coll object for saving presets, I was gonna make preset slots and duplicated them which would have limited how many presets could be made..). one interesting, almost gamechanging discovery was this.
https://cycling74.com/forums/multi-colors-in-a-kslider

This could have almost made my whole project futile and become 1 simple object. However, the kslider has limitations which wouldn't allow for 1 possible colour at a time. Crises averted!

Due to my clumbsyness I managed to blow the strip LED's days before it was to be handed in.... what rubs salt into the would is that I was finally managing to work the Serialports to take the information correctly.. looks like im going to have to focus on building it theoretically with the maxpatch
