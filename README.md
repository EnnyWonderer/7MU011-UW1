## Wake'n'Make Production Videos


This shows the birth of the Wake'n'Make concept, through developing a pilot based of peoples interaction it was fine tuned to both entertain and inspire.

Once I was sure that it was a concept that people were interested in, I Made the Wake'n'Make social media pages and bought the URL www.wakenmake.co.uk (not yet running). I searched for the designer of the popular GIF file 'hang loose' and asked about using their GIF as the official logo for wake'n'make.
I don't know if it was the idea of me offering a percentage of any profits made that put him of but after that he wouldn't even accept money... I told him the idea of the potential merch and stuff and he dissed me. The discussion showed me that they were not willing to negotiate what so ever and was playing very difficult even when trying to establish a better deal. So I designed a temp banner logo myself.

I found myself responding to people who wanted to do their own wakenmakes with "yeah its really habit forming" and so came up with the slogan 'consistency becomes habitual' I also wanted to keep the feel of the 'stoner creative' vibe and so went with Hemp themed colour (spin-off to wake'n'bake... maybe I was high when I started making these videos).
