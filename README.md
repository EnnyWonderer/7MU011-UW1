# Introduction
While it is clear that traditional methods of learning music have proven successful, it only provides for a select learning style and ‘…in doing so fails to reflect the diversity of young people, the ways in which they engage with music and the achievements of those who learn away from the exam system.’(Derbyshire 2015). As children and adults have their own preference for approaching music education, and while establishments continue to use traditions teaching methods, there remains a clear gap in meeting requirements, as ‘…almost half the children who currently play an instrument presently don’t have lessons and almost a fifth of them never have done.’ Akkoyunlu and Soylu explained that ‘the rapid growth in the use of learning technologies… have offered educators many more opportunities to investigate the most suitable learning environments for their students learning styles’. (Fine, 2006) With so many learning styles, and, now, so many learning technologies, there are many routes to take in order to progress in music education. One of the most rewarding areas of learning is self- teaching. Self- learning is not restricted to the guidelines of traditional education, that are often rendered outdated as soon as something new is discovered. Many of the famous names, that have opted for self- learning over traditional education, have been the creators of new waves of thinking, or new technologies (Flora C, 2019). Blake Boles states, ‘…self-directed learners… ditch the well-trodden path, bust out the map and compass, and cut cross-country to virgin territory…’ (Flora , 2019). With the progression of music comes the need for new discoveries, and audio technology allows for the creation of devices to aid the self-learning process. This report looks at creating alternative methods for self-learning in the areas of performance, production and technological advancements.


# Wake’n’Make
Wake’n’Make was a platform designed to present the production process in a format that would, both, entertain and educate viewers while motivating and developing participants. It was noticeable amongst musical peers and myself, that we would only post completed content, i.e. songs/music videos, otherwise there would be no content promoting our craft. Furthermore, there was either a minimal level of production practice or none. This made it more difficult to get into the flow of things when the time did come to create. This may be due to de-motivation, perfectionism, or a simple loss of ideas. Whatever the reason, music artists were losing audience engagement from a lack of content, and a high rank of  importance is placed on having content to progress in an early music career, especially on online sharing platforms. Instagram in particular is ‘very much a content marketing platform’.(NAM 2019)

It seemed necessary to find way to resolve the issue of content, motivation, perfectionism, and consistent practice, all in one concept. Wake’n’Make became an experiment attempting to increase work rate, creating a new habit-forming routine. The story feature on Instagram and Facebook allows a user to post short bursts of content that lasts for 24 hours. This was an instant resolve for the issue with perfectionism, as it removes the feeling of permanence for anything created. However, this didn’t completely resolve the issue with having more content, due to it disappearing after the 24 hours. Instagram has an additional feature that allows users to archive selected story posts into highlights, which do not expire. While this may still not be ideal for a perfectionist, it provided a quick-fix resolve. An additional fix to keeping the content, was to take all the existing posts and edit them into a ‘best moments’ video on ‘Premier Pro’, creating a more tailored post. 
A good counteraction for de-motivation was content feedback. The posts on social media stories allows the user to see how many viewers they are getting from their content and the viewers are able to send instant emoji reactions or to comment providing more in-depth feedback.

Wake’n’Make was not intended to place importance on the final product, only on the journey and the building of a self-directed, creative routine. It was designed for participants to see the benefit starting the day with a creative task, as ‘one of the keys to breaking procrastination is to become an effective starter… in the way you start your day’. (Masters, 2014) Furthermore, taking on a task of this nature at the start of the day means participants are practicing with a fresh mind, increasing the potential for new ideas and the patience to explore different approaches. Finally, the idea that content should be somewhat entertaining, challenges creators to think ‘outside the box’. 

Wake’n’Make was eventually developed to send out challenges for participants who had applied to be put on the mailing list. These challenges were set to develop their approaches to their craft, not their final piece. For example, using the unused: this would challenge participants to come out of their comfort zone of ‘go-to’ tools, and search for unfamiliar tools, learn how they work and incorporate them into their craft. The result was that participants had new tools in their arsenal, increasing the potential routes they could take in their next project.

Evaluation of Wake ‘n’ Make
Wake’n’Make aided as a useful method for developing the approach to creating and learning. The participants became more consistent in their practice and explorative in their approach, while having more content to promote their craft on social media. Unfortunately, the only participants who would share their work with Wake’n’Make were painters who provided their artwork as an animated video leading to the final product. Some musicians did the practice as they were influence by the concept but would not submit any work to be shared under the Wake’n’Make page. However, through viewing their stories there was a noticeable increase in content as the posts become more regular, suggesting a routine had been formed.

The intention for the future of Wake’n’Make, is to curate content from various artists. It is important that improvements are made to encourage participants to submit their content and to become more engaged with the community side of Wake’n’Make, rather than its existence as a solo entity. A way to do this would be a to create a website that would have an upload feature and act as its own social media page for creatives.


# Band Performance: Oneironauts

The background of my music career is rooted in being a rapper. Whilst this has equipped me with many positives, I find there are limitations to performance, as backing tracks are often a rapper’s preference. In order to develop self-learning in live performance, it seemed necessary to pick up an instrument to truly gain an understanding of musical performance. The advantage of being a producer meant that I have experience with composing music and knowledge of how different instruments should sound together. The transferal of gained experience aids in performance, as there is already an intended outcome of what will sound good. My level of experience in performance was the ability to play by ear and recreate what I had heard, but it would take me a while. In order to fully explore music performance and self-learning, two approaches were taken: the learning and teaching of music theory and forming a band.

Before I formed my own band, I trialled playing keyboard in existing bands to understand how people practice and play together, to further figure out important practices. This experience was very educational, especially to experience how much prior knowledge is needed before joining and establishing band. This brought about the seeking of music theory. It is important to know why you are doing what you are doing, not just the ‘what’. Ryan Cooper discusses this issue in other areas of the arts, but it can be relatable to music as he states there is two groups of creatives, the ‘what’ group and the ‘why’ group. The what group is characteristic of ‘people who study their craft and follow tutorials…never caring about anything other than if the technique works or not’ and the ‘why’ group is those who ‘study their craft…while also striving to learn about why what they are learning actually works’. Furthermore he explains that the ‘why’ group end up with a ‘tremendous advantage’ over the ‘what’ group as ‘their deeper understanding of technique gifts them with far more versatility than those who simply collect a library of preset…’ (Cooper R, 2016)While this is a generalisation, I felt it was necessary to understand why to aid in learning retention.  The songs were no longer studied to recreate by ear, rather, to know what the chords are and what scale the whole song falls into. This allows for comfortable playing as there is less work required from memorising masses of small chunks of information; thus, they would be categorised into fewer, big chunks, reducing the brains workload. Noticeably, every time a new theory was introduced, playing a piece of music became a different experience and my playability would increase tenfold.

This concept of knowing the ‘why’ was taken into practice when teaching others. In order to solidify the theories being self-learnt, I felt it necessary to put them into practice. To further experiment with the success of my own self-learning, I created a way to teach my findings to others with no musical experience, during 1 to 1 tutoring sessions and workshops. Students with no prior knowledge were given simple methods, enabling them to gain a better understanding on music theory instantly. After just one session students would be able to identify note names and major and minor chords (by sound and sight), by the next session they would be able to identify major and minor scales and their intervals.

Oneironauts is a Hip-hop fusion trio consisting of bass, percussion (cajon), a drum machine, keyboard and vocals. After playing with existing bands, creating a new band proved far easier, as, regardless of playability, we were all learning and creating the songs at the same time. Having creative control made the processes far easier to remember and it would all be tailored based on current ability or future potential. In utilising the method of learning the theory behind the music and applying it to my own music, I found it much easier to learn and understand as it was closely linked to the way in which I would play naturally. Now I had the advantage of knowing what it was that made my chords have a specific sound (jazzy) and how to take advantage of it. This was also taken into tutoring sessions. I encouraged students to show me what it is that they can play, and I would teach them how to study ‘themselves’.
Evaluation of Performance Learning

Performance based or self-reflective learning resulted in a lot more confidence from students as they were beginning to discover how great they were, through a self-learning and personal exploration. While the theories they were discovering would have been taught in music classes, they would have been taught the ‘what’, whereas with self-discovery they were not only learning ‘what’ but also ‘why’; furthermore, they were not limited to the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of pre-existing music, they were able to understand theory through their own creations. As a result, they are completely free to explore what sounds good, and later find out why it does. I found that this serves their education better, rather than being prescribed a specific thing to have to learn. 
Overall, self-learning in performance led to an understanding of the importance of knowing music theory. The application of theory to practices led to improved and more relaxed playing, and the ability to play with other musicians confidently. As it introduced a simple process of finding the key of the song and adding the chords that best fit. It also improved production as creating chords because more of a ‘second nature’ and Wake’and’Make’s began to display more chords in production, and playing around in the scale made it faster to find good melodies. When teaching students basic theory I found that it also improved their approach to production. Rather than spending a large amount of time hitting keys at random and doing a lot of trial and error for a whole session, they began looking into the chords, writing them down and figuring out different ways to play them. The more advanced students who already performed, displayed more confidence in their playing and could adapt from how they would usually play. This shows that studying the things that you already practice creates a greater knowledge base, allowing the information to become solidified.

While these subprojects acted as methods to explore self-learning, the final outcome of this project was to create an alternative method to develop self-learning. The important features were to have something that could entertain, challenge, create routine, teach theory through simple methods, and display theory in whatever comes as natural to the learner. 


# Synethsteacher

Colour music has a long history, dating back as early as Plato pondering the idea of eight concentric circles, each with a distinctive colour and tone dubbing it "music of the spheres". In addition, Aristotle proposed the first colour-music formula, assigning colours to musical tones according to how the colours and tones blended together (Goldsmith, 2001).  Aside from this, there is a natural ability which takes a similar approach to these theories, this interesting phenomenon is known as synaesthesia. Synesthesia is coined from the Greek words syn meaning ‘together’, and aesthesis meaning ‘perception’. Synesthesia occurs when "sensation in one part of the body is produced by stimulus in another" (online etymology dictionary 2018). The particular type of synaesthesia this project is focusing on is Chromestesia; seeing sounds as shapes and colours. This project combines sound and colour in real time to creatively aid with the learning of music theory.

Existing uses of colour for music education is mainly displayed in method books to highlight new material. “Stimuli received through several senses excite more neurons in several localized areas of the cortex, thereby reinforcing the learning process and improving retention" (Rogers, 1991). While this can be beneficial, its uses has been limited to notation in instructional materials i.e. sight reading, naming letter names of notes and performing from memory.

Devices designed to blend colour and sound are not a new concept. In 1725, Louis-Bertrand Castel introduced the first colour organ “Clavecin pour les yeux” or ‘harpsichord for the eyes’” as technology advanced over the centuries, the colour organ saw many adaptations taking it from coloured paper, to lamps on glass to lights. Companies like Yamaha and Casio released light up keyboards to aid in learning music in the 90’s which allowed the user to play along to existing songs by following the keys that lit up. By 2015 an “illuminating piano” was introduced with a dedicated app that displays interactive digital music sheets and allows learning and playback of music score in colour (Geekwire 2015). These more recent devices had the advantage of technological improvements to take following sheet music to the next step, but never incorporated the innovation to advance learning music theory.
Stimulating more senses 

Yoon states that the left and right hemisphere of the brain is associated with that of logical and creative cognition. Yoon adds that music listening and performance impacts the brain as a whole, stimulating both halves – the analytical brain and the subjective-artistic brain (Yoon, 2000). Williams (1986) Williams confirms that “the right brain is adept at visual imagery. The left hemisphere, sequential and linear in its data processing, moves step by step when processing new information”. Introducing coloured lighting should theoretically stimulate the right brain to be able to process visual and audial information allowing for more analysis once being process in the left brain. This may provide an insight into how the brain may be stimulated in synesthete. 


What is missing in previous devices is the open-ended programming that allows a user to decide how the device teaches them. Platform building is, by definition, a kind of exercise in emergent behaviour. The platform builders do not just open a door in the adjacent possible, they build an entire new floor (Johnson S 2010). A device that can provide real time colour feedback of sound that is also customisable by the users would be revolutionary in music education and self-learning. Johnson (2010) Mentions how the creators of ‘Twitter’ took advantage of having the most diverse ecosystem of software applications being built on your platform. On an open-ended platform, good ideas can come from anywhere. Synesteacher aims to serve as a platform allowing users to customise the software in order to best suit their personal requirements.


# The Build

While the LED inclusion the build was not complete, there was enough done in the Max patch to run a successful prototype of the Synesteacher build.

Goldsmith points out “no common set of color and sound associations exist between individual synesthetes. Synesthesia is a personal experience and the details of the perceptions are completely subjective” # some people see shapes and textures or feel things, to be able to group all of that into one device would be extremely difficult as shapes and textures would have to be pre animated to respond to certain characteristics, this might be overwhelming for users when setting it up for personal uses, so the focus of this device will be sound colour relationships with customisable mapping over the keys. Pre-set colour mappings were set up based on existing theories of light and sound relationships.

# Colour of sound patch

According to Goss (2016) the vibrations of sound and light differentiate as sound is based on vibrations of air molecules and light is based on an electromagnetic wave. While “frequency” is a measure commonly used for both, the two types of waves have substantial differences. frequency of sound can be converted to a frequency of light by continuously doubling the sound frequency (going up one octave each time) until it reaches a frequency in the range of 400–800 THz. That frequency is then converted into a wavelength of light, using the formula:
wavelength = speedOfLight / frequence 

# Scriabin patch

Alexander Scriabin (a synesthete) developed a mapping system between pitches and colours to go with the keys on a keyboard based on his perception.The significance of the placement of colours within is mapping is that similar colours are placed on keys that are a perfect forth and perfect fifth apart rather than next to each other. When this placement is displayed in the circle of fifths the colours appear more systematic and continuous (Goss 2016).


# Problems that arose


the communication between Max and Arduino was difficult to control as all information would go through the serial one after the other. It would have be useful to be able to assign outputs from max to different ports to ensure that information was going to the select path only. Through lots of fine tuning a method was found to set arduino to receive the information in a specified order. But it would occasional send too much or too little information causing the lights to react incorrectly. Another possible reason for this could have been the library Arduino was using for the lights not correctly communicating with the LED strip but it only gave problems with the serial was reading information from Max. Any code sent directly from Arduino worked perfectly. While almost getting close to a resolve. A wire from the lights touched the amp causing them to stop working.  


# Improvements


The current set up of the Project allows users to create their own lighting setup to best suit what it might be they are trying to learn. Future developments of this prototype will have a setting called Scale trainer. The scale trainer setting will feature a dropdown menu listed with different scales (major, minor, blues, Phrygian, Ionian etc) followed by another dropdown menu with starting notes (C, C#, D, D#, E etc). this would potentially utilise a maths coding which will set the lights based on the intervals between the notes to reduce extensive amounts of coding. This feature will allow users to practice different scales with lighting as feedback to see whether they play the scale correct or not. They customisation with still be available for users to improve their understanding and add any interesting discovers (e.g notes that seem to work with the scale that are not necessarily in the scale). Pre-sets will come with information panel explaining the theory linked to the E.g Scriabin setting and the circle of 5ths, this will allow users to further study the theories that may be presented to them.  
For users that are using a piano rather than a midi device a [ftom~] (frequency to midi) object will be added then taking in audio from a microphone (or an audio out if a non-MIDI keyboard is in use). This setup will be better represented with the LED part of the build.

Another intended feature will be harmonic mode. This will light up LED’s that are closest relation to the harmonic frequencies of the note or notes played. This would be to potentially add colour (sound colour that is) to chords through their potential harmonics.


# Conclusion


The Synesteacher prototype acts as a visual sensory feedback tool which can aid in creativity, performance and music education for those who are self-learning or those being taught. With further developments it could become the next platform for technology advancements in music as many devices are progressing with lights becoming more affordable. Synaesthesia is an ability that can be utilised to benefit many people if it is utilised in a correct and constructive way.
